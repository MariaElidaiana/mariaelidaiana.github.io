								<b>A new mass proxy for optical galaxy clusters</b><br>In this project, we propose a new mass proxy for galaxy clusters based on the stellar masses,
								named &mu;<sub><font size="0">&#9733;</font></sub>.
								Besides being physically motivated, &mu;<sub><font size="0">&#9733;</font></sub> is independent of the history's formation of the red-sequence and has the potential
								to better characterize the mass of optical galaxy clusters at high redshifts (z>1).

								<b>Using binary black hole mergers to estimate H<sub>0</sub></b><br>We performed the first measurement of H<sub>0</sub> using the gravitational wave (GW) signals
								   from a binary black hole (BBH) merger in combination with the information from galaxies. This technique is interesting because it does not rely on finding the
									 electromagnetic counterpart of the GW events, which is very rare. The BBH events are frequent, and therefore, in a few years, we will have enough statistics
									 to make this methodology achieve more precise estimates for H<sub>0</sub>.

								<b>The CFHT Stripe 82 Survey</b><br>I am member and builder of the CFTH Stripe 82 survey (CS82) collaboration. CS82 is an i-band survey in 170 deg<sup>2</sup> of
								   the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 that was specially designed for weak lensing measurements. It has an excellent image quality with mean seeing∼0.6"
									 and completeness magnitude of ∼23.5 in the i-band. The survey detected around 17 million objects. The collaboration has several interesting results. The most
									 cited is the result that shows that standard models of the galaxy-halo connection adjusted to reproduce the clustering of the CMASS sample predict a galaxy-galaxy
									 lensing signal that is 20-40% higher than the one we observed in our data.
